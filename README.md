pypboy
======

Remember that one Python Pip-Boy 3000 project? Neither do we!<br>
Python/Pygame interface, emulating that of the Pipboy-3000.<br> 
Uses OSM for map data and has been partially tailored to respond to physical switches over Raspberry Pi's GPIO<br>

## Features
* Work with Screen TFT 3.5" Capacitive of Adafruit
* Works with real gps (TBD)

## Requirements
* Latest 32 bit python 3.7.X
* pygame installed from windows.msi  

## Vision
* Real role play to complete missions and quests.  Interact with other real players
* Network laser tag into game with raspberry pi server running connected to a wifi router (with sim card)
* Real gps is used to pull map from internet 
* Radiation area is configured somehow on raspberry pi server
* Use pipboy screens to choose weapon type to dictate damage dealt on raspberry pi server
* Use pipboy screens to adminster first aid
* Complete actual quests with other players (friendly/neutral/hostile)

## Authors

* By Sabas of The Inventor's House Hackerspace
* By grieve work original<br>
* Paul Richards conversion to 3.5 inch display and runs on pc 
*    Adding gps and real role-play functionality

Rotary Switch
The rotary switch is connected to various pins on the PiTFT. The table below lists out the pin number and GPIO. The colors correspond with the wires in the diagram - these however, can be whatever color you want.

Pin 14 GND 
Other pins: 7, 11, 13, 15, 16

Notes: 
   * Wifi internet connection is required to load the map
   * For Testing you can enter a knob number 1-5 to simulate a knob selection.
   * Press ESC to stop the program
   
   * config.py has all the knob definitions 
   * game/core.py 
      Engine class has the render which renders the active module
   * pypboy/__init__.py has a SubModule class which is inherited by pypboy/modules/data/quests.py
   * pypboy/core.py 
      looks for events and handles the actions and adds modules for data, items, and stats
   * pypboy/data.py not sure what GRID_SIZE/SIG_PLACES 
   * pypboy/modules/data/__init__ creates a list of modules that have functionality
   * pypboy/modules/data/entities.py Map writes the emenity on the map
   * pypboy/modules/data/local_map.py init has a call to fet_map with radius 
      This radius controls the size of the map, it would be nice to be able to zoom  
   * pypboy/ui.py Menu.handle_action handles the dial_up and dial_down action
